Charity is meant for the general betterment of society. The allocation of donations must be strictly monitored to ensure that it does not end up in the wrong hands. There is much hardship in the world, and it is the fortunate man's inherit duty to help better those who are less fortunate. Our platform helps users to connect with various NGOs and donate common household items to them.
